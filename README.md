# iFunny-Remover
Removes the iFunny Watermark from .jpg's

iFunny Remover goes through every .jpg file that shares the folder with it, strips off the bottom 20px of the images, and saves the resulting .jpg's in a folder titled "output".

Be advised that there's no warning before the script starts, and it doesn't actually verify there's an iFunny watermark before it removes it. Make sure you only store this script with files you intend to cut!
